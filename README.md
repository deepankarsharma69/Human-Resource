# Human-Resource
First I have downloaded the master file of Human Resource from Git Hub.
Second I created the database on My SQL by the name of projects and imported the master file into this data base so that i can clean the data and to retrieve out necessary insights.
I checked the format of the data after importing the file in My SQL and change the format of termdate and hire_date into a uniform format.
After making the date format uniform, I started retrieving the insights from the master file 
I have also uploaded the SQL script file in this repository by the name of projects where I have written SQL queries under proper heading.
There are total of 10 findings to make the data insightful.
**POWER BI** file has been uploaded by the name of **HR Employement distribution report**
**My SQL** file has been uploaded by the name of **Projects**
